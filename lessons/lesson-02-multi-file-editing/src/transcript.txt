Welcome to Principled AI Coding, Lesson Two.

You've learned the fundamentals. Now let's progress to the next level of AI coding with multi-file editing. AI coding across multiple files is a no-brainer must-have necessity for efficient engineering in the age of generative AI.

In this lesson, we're going to build on the fundamentals so you can quickly create and modify files across your codebase quickly and concisely.

Before we dive in, let's establish the key principle behind this lesson: The Big Three Bulls-Eye.

At the heart of every AI coding assistant, there are three vital components that make the magic happen:

1. Context
2. Model
3. Prompt

We refer to these as "The Big Three." Master these three elements and you'll unlock the full power of AI coding for today's tools and tomorrow's tools.
