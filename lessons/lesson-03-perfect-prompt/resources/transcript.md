Welcome to Lesson three your last beginner, principled AI coding lesson over lesson one and two, you've learned the basics and learned the essential commands to give your AI coding assistant the context it needs to run multi file edits Now it's time to learn how to craft the perfect prompt.
As you may have noticed, not all prompts get the job done in this lesson you're going to learn specific keywords and prompt phrases that will generate the exact results you're looking for.
That means you'll spend less time reviewing your AI coding assistance outputs and more time shipping valuable features for your projects and your work lesson by lesson you unlocking massive productivity multipliers by using AI coding tools, the right way Crafting great AI coding prompts is about knowing how your AI coding assistant and the underlying large language model will respond to your prompt.
You want to be consistently hitting the big three bulls eye the intersection between your prompt, your context and your model.
They are going to be Many engineers using a coding tools there already are, but most engineers will be writing ineffective, nondescript, error prone prompts that they'll have to fix and iterate on this lesson is going to help you bypass all of these issues and save a ton of time crafting the perfect prompt begins with understanding the principle behind this lesson, let me introduce you to IDK, also known as information dense keywords ID KS are a result of the simple train of logic prompts are made up of individual keywords, Some of these keywords contain more information, they carry more meaning and more action with them.
All keywords are not equal to each other.
Therefore, we should select the highest performing keywords based on their information density to create the best prompts.
Simple enough, right, I'm basically calling out the fact that if you want to communicate something to an LM or to a person, there are better and worse ways to communicate.
It's an obvious but important point to make to the idea behind information Dense keywords is to find and use the most valuable information rich words that best communicates what you want done to your AI coding assistant.
The principle for this lesson use information, dense keywords It's as simple as that this is no different than if you're trying to convince, teach, discuss or communicate something with a friend, family or co-worker Some words are more impactful than others.
It's the same with your AI coding assistant and your language models.
Now naturally you're probably thinking what are these keywords there are quite a few of them and in this lesson we're going to go over the most impactful ones and we're going to compose these keywords by building repeatable prompt phrases.
These prompt phrases will give you reliable, repeatable patterns for generating great AI coding prompts.
Let's dive in and see the results that information, dense keywords and prompt phrases can have on your ability to generate lots of code quickly and accurately with your AI coding assist.
Let's open up the terminal and clone in the lesson three repository.
As always, the link will be in your loop box below.
If ILs you can see our previous two lessons I'll run, get Colog pace in the Orl.
Now if I run Els, I can now see our third lesson.
Let's CD into our new directory and open your favorite code editor.
I'll use VS codes, I'll type codet, Go ahead and copy your.environment variable file from your lesson to code Base into the directory or open up the Read Me and follow the second set up instruction here.
Copy your.and sample into the.in and set up your Open AI and or your enthropic Api use whichever you prefer, they're both going to provide a great out of the box model for your AI coding I go ahead and grab my.environment Variable
Now once you have your.in file set up open up a terminal and install our dependencies.
I'm going to run UV Sync and then we can run UV run main transcript.txt.
This will kick off our previous version and if we go into Source Main you can see we're right where we left off from our second AI coding lesson, we're going to build off our lesson to repository and add some additional features to our transcript analysis application, just like in lesson two, Let's start by outlining the changes we're going to make to our transcription app planning at work is an important pattern we're going to fully utilize in upcoming lessons it's also a great engineering practice to plan your work before you start coding right now our transcription application reads in a text file of a Youtube video or presentation counts the frequencies of words and then uses openi to generate a summary determine sentiment and extract keywords we can see the output of our run.
Here we have a list of words with their frequencies and we have a transcription analysis with a quick summary bullet point highlights, sentiment analysis and keywords.
We set this up in lesson one and two and in this lesson we're going to improve it by making a few changes, we're going to add an output flag so we can output our analysis in JSON, markdown or plain text files
This gets us out of viewing our results from only the seal lie then we'll update our application to output a bar chart for word frequencies this will make it easier to digest our word frequencies and understand the most common words.
Right now we're using this simple hashtag pattern.
This is a great start, but we're going to improve it.
These features will move our Ci transcription app toward a more useful production ready tool.
Our main focus, though, is on the AI coding involved in getting these features built, not the features themselves.
Now let's start by listing the most important, most valuable, most common information dense keywords.
We first have Create, Update, Delete, then we have Add, Remove, Move, replace, Save mirror Then there is VAR function class Type File Default These keywords are distinct even though they may have equal alternatives, they are clear, concise and have a direct action or meaning associated with them right away.
It's important to call out a few things These keywords have variants.
For instance, the Update keyword can be replaced with Change Create can be replaced by build, Delete can be replaced by Remove, but you can see how the information density of the idea of creating is lost the further you travel away from the word, for instance write, build, make code every one of these steps, although they are all variants and will likely all work.
You don't want to drift too far away from what you're actually trying to do.
These information dense keywords are are important because they capture the most common operations for AI coding.
The first three are the most important create, update and delete
In each programming language, using a specific VAR or function or type appropriate keyword usually results in more accurate prompts.
For instance, in Typescript you would identify a function with the function keyword as we have here and as you'll see in a moment we use the def keyword.
Files are another example.
We use file extensions to denote the file information Dense keyword in lesson to We ran a prompt like create org parse.py the.py is what makes this string and IDK and information dense keyword.
By adding.py to something, we make it an information dense keyword because the underlying language model knows that.py is one of hundreds of file extensions.
Last thing to note this is a limited list of the essential ID KS you will and likely already have run into.
There are more Take note the words and these strings you keep writing and your prompts that tend to work.
They are likely, I decays, now.
Instead of trying to cherry pick prompts to show off ID, ks, let's write real prompts to build up.
These features will start by adding an output flag to our transcription analysis code base.
Let's go ahead and open the terminal.
Clear our output and boot up AER When to hit Slash, add Main, Use AER's Auto Complete to grab the main file and then I'll hit space to add another file and I'm also going to add our data types.
Why do we want data types?
Let's go ahead and open our data types file.
We have our transcript analysis here and we're going to be working with that in this prompt to kick things off, will execute an AI coding prompt to generate that new output format using several IDK from now on I'm going to capitalize the keywords where it makes sense so it's clear in our A coding prompts where the information dense keywords are Let's talk back to Main, open up our code and just to quickly review, We're opening up our transcription file.
We're counting the word frequencies, we're sorting them and they were printing and they were running our openai call to run our sentiment analysis.
If we open to this function you can see what that looks like here and then we're just printing it out.
So let's go and make our modifications that we can output files and different formats.
We'll deal with this prompt Create output format PY colon So going to create a new file here, create def format as stir and then I'm going to pass in transcript and then colon transcript analysis.
You can see either has the context of our data types so it's giving us some nice auto complete Here we're going to highlight our transcript analysis type and now we're going to specify the return type in pythons are going to say greater than strings, we want to get strings back from this function.
Let's go and continue and then we'll reflect on this prompt.
In a moment I'm going to use a comma here to denote a list, and then I'll also type format as JSON, format as markdown dot.then update main.py Right because after we create this file, that formats our transcript analysis we now need to update our main file to use that new code so now I'm going to explicitly say update main colon Add all caps AI Rg for file output format Default text writes were saying I'll use a comma here just to add another detail and I'll say save output to file with proper extension.
Okay this is our a coding prompt let's fire it off.
Right let's finally get some a coding, let's see the results as we can see it or walking through these changes for us wonderful this is our new file.
We got the imports, we have the flag and we have the output format wonderful so asking us if we want to create this new output format file, we're going to go ahead and say yes, of course and now Ader has made those changes for us so you can see we also have that added to our context, we can go ahead and look at that new file, so we have every function just as we asked format as string format as JSON format as markdown if we hop back to Main we can see we now have that new parser arg Interestingly, here we forgot to add the context of our Arg parse file Right, which is where we're actually doing our argument parsing so we can go ahead and fix that.
Let's first continue reviewing our code we can see here at The Bottom we're now looking at our response formats and based on the response format, we're now getting that concrete output file type, so we're running our format as string format as JSON format as marked down and then our file extension is getting passed to our output file and finally created Let's go ahead and get this parser code moved into the Arg parse file by adding this file to our contact so just say/add arg Parse you can see Eers Auto complete kicking in there will accept that.
So let's go ahead and write that prompt to move our output format into our org parse file, so to do that will just write move output format see Lirg into art parse PY Okay, so kick that off this is going to go ahead and move that code over so if you move over to Art Parse we can see that moved properly.
Let's go ahead and execute our code.
Let's go ahead, open up a new terminal in VS code.
We can use command Shift J and let's run this code, so I'll type UV, run Main Transcript txt.
Let's go ahead and use our new Flags All type output Dash format and then I'll specify markdown and now we have our transcript analysis saved to Transcript analysis.md.
We can see this file created here.
If we click this you can see we're now getting this great mark down Summary
This is much easier to read right this is a great format.
It's also a concrete file so we can keep track of all of our generations.
We can go ahead, run this again, we'll come back to the terminal, hit up and then let's generate our JSON version.
Wonderful now we have our transcript analysis.json.
If we look at that, we have a wonderful JSON file breakdown that we can reuse across other applications.
Our coding proms ran really well, we did miss the context of our Arg parse file on the first go around, so you saw our A coding assistant did not have visibility into this file.
Right, so it just added that additional argument to the main that's Okay.
We ran another prompt we made sure that we had all the contacts we needed and that we use an information dense keyword prompt to move that content.
So let's go out and backtrack and look at the prompts and break them down so I hit pop a few times.
Get back to our prompt, let's go ahead and move it to a new file, then's do some formatting so I'm going to format here, I'll format here we have two file create statements here great so this is what this looks like when we format a little bit now let's go and walk through this Okay we have 12345 information dense keywords in this prompt and there are actually quite a few more will note in a moment let's start of the top we said, Create output format.py
So even just in these two strings we have a decent amount of information here.
Right, we want to create a new file and we're specifying this file by saying Output format.py Keep in mind if you remove.py it's not clear if this is a variable, if this is a function if this is a class What is output format?
Okay, but by adding PY it's clear to our AI coding assistant and really the language model underneath it, that this is a Python file now inside of that re use colon to kind of denote the nested level.
Here it's important to note that this colon here doesn't need to be a colon.
Right you could use a-here, I recommend using colons because it's consistent and it's simple.
Next we have another Create keyword and now we have deff format as string.
So now we're using that Python function keyword and now we're specifying what we want done, We want to create this format as string method and we're specifying the parameters when we say transcript analysis, it knows by reference we're talking about this class exactly, so we want to pass that class in and then we're also specifying the return type in this one line, even if you take off the Create keyword
There is a lot of information here.
Right, we're passing in our parameter and our ACN assent can infer take this and turn it into a string and if we look at that file or if we look at our output file, That's exactly what it did right, it inferred that exactly exclusively based on our function definition this is an alter, powerful pattern, especially when our context and function names are enough for the model to infer the content of the function itself, you can write tons of code by providing the right function definition, Hold on to this idea we're then using the list syntax with these commas.
Remember we're communicating to LMS and they of course know that a comma means we're separating items in a list that enables us to drop the other pieces of our function.
Keyword right so you can see here we also want format is JSON format is markdown and we're dropping the def keyword and we're also skipping the parameters.
Right LMS are great at pattern recognition, this is a pattern Okay, so that's kind of one block of code changes and then we have another block down here.
Right Update main PY update the main file right to information dense keywords colon we're saying add note notice how this is not create right, this could very well be create and it would very likely work, but notice the detail of using an add keyword AD means we're Attaching to things that already exist where we already have Seerg so add is a little more information rich here I know that sounds really niche and really unnecessary, but as your context grows as you're working with hundreds and hundreds of files a little change like this can make a difference and trust me, I've seen it does make a difference, so add a ci AR for file output format and they were using the default keywords A very common one a big piece of great engineering is setting up great defaults, so are saying default text comma right, so we have this list pattern once again save output to file with proper extension and if we look at Main we can see that that is exactly what happened.
Right, we have our
Orgs output formatting checked and then we're also saving the file extension properly based on the output format.
Now when we work through it, there's actually a lot of information we're sending to our a coding assistant in this, a coding prompt we're being clear and concise without going into the details of how to do it.
Remember what greater than how the what is more important than the how not completely but much, much more than it has been so, even though we are not being verbose about how to implement each function you might be thinking, isn't this some of the work we're supposed to be passing off to our AI coding assistance.
Can't I just write something like this right like add JSON, markdown and taxi Rg output formats, then update main.
Can you just rent something like this vs this, right, and you can see here this is a 128 characters here we have 66.
The answer, of course, is yes, you very likely could have you, You may have gotten away with it right, if you had all the right context set up and it may have worked, but notice I keep using these conditional words It may have worked, probably especially when you're starting, it's best to start out with these detailed low level prompts and slowly move to higher level prompts right mid level High Level prompts with less explicit information in them will discuss this idea more throughout this lesson and in future lessons, Look at how much information this High Level prompt is missing right add Jason, mark down and text where where are we adding these then update main update what in main right after after what, what do you mean by output formats are you just saying create a string are you saying create a file already returning, already printing What's what's happening here?
You see how much information is missing from this High Level coding prompt vs our low level detailed coding.
Prompt Right Create output format PY Okay, we're going to create a file create deft format as string return a string pass in the transcript.
Oh Okay we're going to format this type as a string, return it and then do JSON and then do markdown Okay I can see this is in list formats you want me to create many of these.dot.okay probably means we want to pass in transcript update main Okay, so now we're creating and then we're updating Main I can see that this is after disk gets generated right and then we were saying add C Rg for output format, default text And then we were saying save output file with proper extension, Do you see how much more information is in the low level prompt
This is important.
We're going to talk about this more.
The general theme is as you're learning a coding, start with low level prompts and then slowly remove information as you're progressing.
Slowly start to remove things.
Right, maybe you don't need the def keyword here.
Right, you can experiment with removing this, right maybe create is unnecessary here, right because we're already saying put it in the output format file, it doesn't exist, so maybe we're just creating it.
Maybe you don't need to explicitly say update, mean these are things and ideas you can play with, but when you're starting, when you're beginning your a coding journey and when you want to progress and actually get things done, just write the extra characters communicate clearly to your large language model and most importantly, communicate clearly with yourself, know exactly the output you want to see by creating the low level prompt so let's go ahead, move on We spend a lot of time digging into this prompt, dissecting it.
Let's write a couple more prompts by building out our next features and then let's move on to breaking down the prompt phrases.
As you can see here, there are repeatable patterns embedded in our prompt here that you can reuse with AER and every single a coding tool moving forward.
So let's go ahead and get rid of this and let's move on to our next feature, So let's go ahead and update our transcript analysis application to output a bar chart for word frequencies instead of our pseudo hash tag bar chart.
Right, if we hop back to AER, let's go ahead and drop all of our files from AERs context window looking to that with Slash Drop only to show you two tricks you can use to speed up your context manage.
We've been adding files, but you can also specify entire directory, So if we do something like this, we say/add source and let's also add our PY project.taml file and enter here you can see every file underneath our source got added so we have our name, we have our our parse constants data LM that's everything that is not get ignored, that's really important inside of our directory, so that's a very powerful tool if you want to add a bunch of context right away, let's use a new command available to you in AER this is effectively your chat conversation that you can have with a or if we go and clear and type Slash Ask You can now ask a or any question you want to about your code base.
So let's go and just ask what libraries do we have for creating bar charts and that's just in question format so nothing fancy here, no special prompt phrases or IDK is in use.
I'm just asking a question right if we open this up a little bit, scroll up you can see AER with the/ask command is just responding to us and it's picked up on the fact that we have this Matplotlib library in our PY project, so we can use this library to create our bar chart and you can use the Ask at any point in time when you're working with your A coding assistant to ask a question about the files in your context window.
Nearly every a coding assistant today and in the future will have some type of chat conversation window, some type of, you know, conversational element where you can just effectively talk to your code base.
This is a really important pattern and something I want to mention so that you're aware of it whenever you're visiting.
Code bases Opening up new code bases you can always just type Slash ask what does this code base do?
Right and really you can ask anything.
Jen is giving US-A nice summary of what the application does.
Transcript analysis, work counting output seei so on and so forth, right, so let's go ahead and create this bar chart so I'll go ahead and drop and then I'll just add what we need to run this prompt so it's going to be/add Let's bring back our project Tamil so that A or knows we have access to Matplot lib I'll add main and this should be all we need here, so we'll just use these files I'll clear and now let's go ahead and write our concise information dense, keyword rich, prompt create following that same pattern chart up PY Colon de Word count bar chart word count d***
This is really important.
I'm referencing a variable that exists in our main file.
Right if we search word count you can see that is a variable here colon so inside of this show horizontal bar chart sort descending after that I'll type Update main right, so now after we have that bar chart generated Update Main replace Let me make sure I have my COL in there.
Replace Word count print with word count bar chart, I'm explicitly saying replace our word count with the new function that we have created, then I'll say move threshold logic after for word loop remember we have this threshold logic that's happening inside of our print we are replacing our work on print You have to be careful and always aware of the changes your A coding assistant is going to make so we're just saying move threshold logic after our four word loop, This prompt looks good we're going to make one additional change here we want to make sure that our threshold word count is actually used inside of our word count and so I'm going to do is back up a little bit and I'm going to use our threshold keyword to our advantage threshold word count as the variable name that's going to be passed in this in combination with our move threshold logic should give our encoding system everything it needs to solve this you will go ahead and enter here hit Yes so we're going to create both these items and let's go ahead and look so you can see there that was a key change that we made there threshold word count so that's getting passed in by variable name and this is the power of Let's go in and just you know, revisit that prompt for just a moment here, so I'm going to copy this and paste this, this is the power of using variable keywords Right, that's really, really important here we pass this in as a variable keyword we knew that we needed to move our threshold logic after the four word loop to use this variable to make sure that that content would be passed back in.
Remember we're focusing on crafting the perfect a coding prompt so that's how we got it there so you can see our word count bar chart is getting created here.
We didn't say how to do it.
All we did was ask our coding assistant to get it done for us by defining the function definition right, so we have word count bar chart passing the content and add a detail for what exactly we want to have done so let's go and run this, let's make sure that this works Always show the proof so I'll just type, I'll use control are for back search and I'll just look for run so we'll run this wonderful, this is really cool.
Right, so now we have this nice bar chart that we can look at our word count frequencies through and we can a lot more clearly see the counts here.
Let's go and close this and you can see our application is still spinning a little bit now it's making that Open AI call so it's going to make a couple tweaks here, right so we have our display of our bar chart here and then we have our analyzed transcript functionality, so let's go ahead and update our min threshold because if we look at our arc parse file default three, so not super useful and let's go ahead and run another prompt to move word count bar chart below our analysis just that we get our analysis first, we don't want the application to stall in a weird way again will fire off a really simple a coding prompt for this and it will break down the ID case and the prompt phrases inside of this a coding prompt so go and clear and then I'll run update and if we look at our art parts here we can see what we have Yeah so I want to update this so I want to say update and you know, always feel free to copy content right end so I going to update mininm threshold default ten let's bump up to ten and I'll say move so if we hop back to main here
I want to move this so I'll just say move bar chart and let's be really explicit.
Right we want to c*** perfect prompts so I'll copy this function, move this below this, that's it fired off and so you know with these keywords with this functionality you can see that things are happening very precisely right, we're crafting perfect prompt we're getting the exact result we're looking for without going into too much of the detail of how we're doing everything, so if we look at our parser, we now have set defaults, Set the ten I haven't seen the syntax
This is new every once in a while your E coding system is just going to do something new that you likely haven't seen.
Let's just run it and see if it works so we'll go ahead and rerun, we'll just look for the run and let's go an update to markdown and let's kick this off.
So now we're going to run our Open AI transcript analysis call first and then create a bar chart so that's what's happening right now, perfect so now we have this, that threshold is working right, so now we're getting a nice clean list.
You can also see we are not getting our sorted items, so let's go ahead and make that happens we'll just close this so if we look back at this, our coding assistant did just completely miss this and we'll just do our same formatting here.
Right, you can see we did explicitly say sort descending spelled wrongs go MA mess here this is something that was just completely missed, Right, maybe because I spelled it wrong.
This is something that an Aing system should easily be able to fix.
It didn't That's reality.
Sometimes things just don't work really quickly.
By validating our code we found that and we can now just come in update word count and we can see either giving us auto complete sort descending so that's all we need, our A coding assistant will know that this is the function that we want to update.
Right there's no way it can get this confused with anything else, just hit that and you can see in this file it fixed that ran the zip and now we should be able to just go ahead and rerun this and see all of our counts sorted descending wonderful so looking a lot cleaner.
Right you can is file I so forth so let's go and break down this prompt create chart, word count bar chart we have a variable here and then we're saying inside of this method
I want you to show horizontal bar chart.
Next we have another grouping of changes inside this file update may not be Why replace word count print with our function?
There is no way for the LM to get this confused.
It either has to just blindly hallucinate or it needs to get it right and this is part of accurate AI coding.
You need to create scenarios where there is no room for interpretation.
Right, if you want to craft perfect prompts, the information needs to be completely clear.
We then say move special logic after for word loop and this worked for the most part.
We did miss our sort descending again.
I'd miss the a** there, so maybe we can say that I calls that hallucination.
If you run this you will likely not run into this issue here.
It will probably have gotten that sort descending call for you.
This is wonderful.
Right, we're so writing low level prompts let's add another layer to this and just make this pattern really discreet and really clear you know normally we do something like this, What do you see here right you see a location phrase it's going to bump this up a little bit right, you see a location and then you see an action then you see a detail here we see a location we see an action and then we see a detail right, and we can really actually bump this to its own line as well.
Right location action detail action detail Okay, this is prompt phrasing.
Right, we are breaking our prompts down into individual pieces, locations, actions, details, It's important to note that a function, as you saw in our previous prompt, If we backtrack a little bit hit up right we can see that our function operated as a location and a detail.
There is no other place where word count bar chart exists in this code base.
Right we can search this and all you see is this function definition and then it getting imported and used this is a really really important idea for you to hold on to.
Right if we hit up again you can see that same pattern.
Right so we're saying update min count threshold if we search min count threshold where is that?
It's here, it's our default argument, this is both a location and a detail, right, so we're saying update this location in this case it's a variable Right, so you see this as a variable you see this as a function and of course we've been writing it mostly as a file we have location action detail
So this is a great way to raft repeatable, consistent prompts and all we're trying to do here with this pattern is consistently communicate to our large language model and our ecoding assistant Where and what?
Notice I didn't say how to create this bar chart.
All I did was add the right context PY projects.tamal Right, if you open that up you can see we have Mat Paul Lib Right there we have four dependencies and our Aount system can see everything in this file right and at the time of writing that prompt we also had main Okay, so it had all this information and it had the information we're giving it in our prompt.
This is a really important pattern you're going to see throughout this course and it's a great consistent way for you to think about, you get an idea you get a feature you have requirements for a brand New feature for your work
For your application
Now you have a repeatable structure to write it out in a prompt that's going to give you great results.
Now the game is about how much time are you training off trying to hit the big three bull's eye right, spending time gathering the right context, writing the right prompt how much time do you spend setting up that intersection and then crafting a great information dense keyword prompt with a repeatable pattern like prompt phrasing.
Right let's just run the one more time location action detail all right, so we're making a lot of great progress here, let's round things out by making a few last changes.
Let's close this, let's just go ahead and do a full reset, let's clear, let's drop and much of programming is setting up patterns and then using those patterns, the mirror keyword lets you tap into that element of engineering with a single word right, this is why it's an information duds keyword We're going to run our next prompt with a powerful mirror keyword
As an example, let's say we want to add another output format.
Right let's say we want to add YAML, so I'll go ahead, I'll add main, I'll add our format and I'll add our Pie project so that we can see Pie YAML library so we have these items Slash token We're running a prompt at under sent for the input.
Tokens also need to add one more file.
We need our hard parse because this also has our output format list, so we'll just say/out hard parse and then let's go ahead and write this prompt.
All we have to say here is Update main PY output format WY and art parts AD format as YAML and also same mirror format as JSON will kick that off through saying, you know three files we have three locations and then we have a function name and then a detail so you can see that's all getting added.
We have a three file multi file edit.
Let's go and kick this off with UV Run Main Transcript Xt Output Format YAML Wonderful so we have our bar chart here.
If we close this we're going to see our YAML file.
Right, we can go ahead, take a look at this, open this up and in YAML format.
We now have our quick summary bullet, highlights, sentiment and our keywords and if we quickly review this prompt you can see the exact same patterns, right, and you're starting to understand everything that's going on here.
Right we're saying update and we're using a list here, there's a combination of some patterns you've been working with, we have a location we have an action and then we have a detail we're using the Update, Add and mirror keywords to get the job done by crafting low level prompts before we move to High Level prompts and by using information, dense keywords and prompt phrases you can consistently build high, quality, accurate AI Coding Prompts as models progress and this is the key we're setting ourselves up to win as models progress right, these large language models are going to continue to improve, so we're building up our skills we need to control and guide our AI coding assistance to produce the results we're trying to get play with these ideas, test them out, Find your own IDK and reuse the ones you've seen here in this lesson to get a lot done in a little bit of time with just a tad more upfront investment in crafting a great prompt congratulations if you made it this far and your understanding, the concepts you are now an intermediate AI Coder Congratulations Take what you've learned here and use it on real code basis, Don't wait hop into code bases focus on using the big Three Bulls Eye Focus on using IDK Right use these information dense keywords Create, update, delete, move mirror There's a whole bag of them, something to put what you're learning into practice, Get that experience, Deploy your AI coding assistant and get work done in upcoming lessons we're going to break down common pitfalls and solution to these pitfalls so that you can continue progressing and we're going to generate a ton of code with the strong week model pattern using reasoning models as orchestrators take a well deserved break for free to browse all the content and guides in your loop Boox that will help you memorize and understand everything we've discussed in these lessons in real world engineering scenarios we've covered High Level vs low level information, dense keywords and prompt phrases put these pieces together so that you can consistently craft high, quality, accurate AI coding prompts a great job So far I'll see you in the next one where things really take off.
