● Agentic Coding Aspects of Lesson 7

  Core Agentic Principles

  - Autonomous Problem-Solving: AI agent iteratively solves problems without human intervention
  - Self-Correction: Agent detects its own errors and fixes them automatically
  - Goal-Oriented Behavior: Agent works toward a defined objective until completion
  - Feedback-Driven Iteration: Each loop incorporates learnings from previous attempts

  Agentic Architecture Components

  - Multi-Agent Collaboration: Coder model (Claude/GPT) + Evaluator model (GPT-4o/o1) working
  together
  - Programmable AI Assistant: Aider as scriptable foundation enabling agentic workflows
  - Closed-Loop System: Output feeds back as input for continuous improvement
  - Stateful Iteration: Maintains context and progress across multiple attempts

  Autonomous Workflow Elements

  - Automatic Error Detection: Tests fail → agent identifies issue → generates fix
  - Completion Recognition: Agent knows when task is truly done vs partially complete
  - Missing Implementation Discovery: Evaluator catches gaps the coder missed
  - Progressive Refinement: Each iteration builds on previous work

  LLM-as-Judge Pattern

  - AI Evaluating AI: One LLM grades another LLM's output
  - Structured Evaluation: Returns success/failure + specific feedback
  - Context-Aware Assessment: Evaluates against original requirements, not just syntax
  - Fallback Mechanisms: Secondary models if primary evaluation fails

  Execution-Evaluation Loop

  - Code Generation → Execution → Result Analysis → Feedback Generation → Retry
  - Concrete Validation: Real test execution, not theoretical assessment
  - Output-Based Decisions: Actual program behavior drives next steps
  - Maximum Iteration Limits: Prevents infinite loops (e.g., 5 attempts max)

  Agentic Planning Features

  - Spec-Driven Development: Detailed specifications guide autonomous implementation
  - Task Decomposition: Agent breaks complex features into manageable steps
  - Context Management: Agent determines which files to edit/read
  - Test-Driven Validation: Agent writes and uses tests to verify its own work

  Intelligence Amplification

  - From "How" to "What": Engineers specify outcomes, not implementation details
  - Workflow Curation: Humans design patterns, AI executes them
  - Asymmetric Productivity: Small planning effort yields large implementation output
  - Iterative Learning: Agent improves within single session through feedback

  Practical Agentic Behaviors Observed

  - Partial Completion Handling: Agent continues when model stops early
  - Error Recovery: Matplotlib error → agent switches to pyplot.subplots()
  - Completeness Checking: "Tests passed but slider test missing" → adds missing test
  - Multi-Step Execution: 4 autonomous iterations to complete complex feature

  Agentic Tool Integration

  - Aider as Foundation: Programmable base for building agents
  - YAML Configuration: Declarative agent behavior specification
  - Logging System: Full audit trail of agent decisions and actions
  - Model Selection: Different models for different agent roles

  Future-Looking Agentic Aspects

  - Self-Directing Development: Code that writes and improves itself
  - Reasoning Model Integration: o1 models for better evaluation and planning
  - Pattern Replication: This 300-line implementation hints at future IDE features
  - Scalable Autonomy: Pattern works from small fixes to entire features

  Key Agentic Limitations

  - Requires Measurable Success Criteria: Need executable validation commands
  - Feedback Loop Dependency: Won't work without concrete output to evaluate
  - Context Window Constraints: Limited by model's ability to hold full problem state
  - Planning Quality Dependency: Agent only as good as initial specification

  Agentic Mindset Shift

  - Engineers as Orchestrators: Direct AI agents rather than write code
  - Planning as Programming: Specifications become executable through agents
  - Validation-First Development: Success criteria drives autonomous implementation
  - Iterative Confidence: Trust in agent's ability to self-correct through loops
