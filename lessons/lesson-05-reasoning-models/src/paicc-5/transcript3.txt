Good morning, team. Let's kick off our sprint planning session.

Our velocity last sprint was 45 story points, slightly below our average. We had some unexpected bugs that consumed development time. The team handled these issues professionally and maintained code quality.

For this sprint, we have several high-priority items in the backlog. The payment integration feature is critical for our upcoming release. We also need to address technical debt in the authentication module.

I propose we commit to 40 story points this sprint, considering the complexity of the payment integration. This gives us buffer for thorough testing and potential blockers.

The design team has completed mockups for the new dashboard. These look fantastic and should improve user engagement significantly. Development can begin once we finalize the API specifications.

Any questions or concerns about the proposed sprint goals? Remember, sustainable pace is more important than rushing features. Quality remains our top priority.

Let's make this sprint productive and collaborative. Thank you for your continued excellence.
