Prompt chaining is a powerful technique in AI engineering that allows us to break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps. By chaining multiple prompts together, we can achieve results that would be difficult or impossible with a single prompt.

The basic principle involves using the output from one prompt as input for the next. This creates a pipeline where each step refines or transforms the data progressively. Think of it like an assembly line where each station adds specific value to the final product.

One common pattern is the extract-transform-validate chain. First, we extract relevant information from raw data. Then we transform it into the desired format. Finally, we validate the results against our requirements. Each step can have specialized prompts optimized for that specific task.

Context management is crucial in prompt chaining. As we move through the chain, we need to maintain relevant context while avoiding information overload. This often means summarizing previous steps or selectively passing forward only the most relevant information.

Error propagation is another important consideration. If one step in the chain fails or produces unexpected output, it can cascade through subsequent steps. Implementing checkpoints and validation between steps helps catch issues early.

The technique really shines in complex analytical tasks. For example, analyzing customer feedback might involve sentiment analysis, topic extraction, issue categorization, and priority scoring. Each of these can be a separate link in the chain with its own optimized prompt.

Prompt chaining also enables iterative refinement. We can loop back to earlier steps based on later results, creating feedback loops that improve output quality. This is particularly useful in creative tasks where initial results might need multiple rounds of refinement.

From a performance perspective, prompt chaining can be more efficient than trying to handle everything in a single complex prompt. Smaller, focused prompts tend to be more reliable and easier to debug. They also allow for parallel processing when steps are independent.

The key to successful prompt chaining is careful planning. Map out the entire flow before implementation. Identify dependencies between steps and plan for edge cases. Good documentation of each step's purpose and expected inputs/outputs is essential for maintenance.
